## FAQ
**Do I need my iPhone nearby?**

**Do I need a subscription?**  
**No.** WatchCloud is a one-time purchase with no subscriptions or in-app purchases.

**Which watches are supported?**  
All Apple Watch models running **watchOS 10** or newer are fully supported.

**Having trouble starting playback?**    
Please make sure you’re running **WatchCloud 2.1.0 or later**. A recent SoundCloud API update required an app update to keep streaming working. The app's version is displayed in the Settings page of the watch app.
